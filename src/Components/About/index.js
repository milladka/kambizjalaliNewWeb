            <strong>Kambiz Jalali</strong> was born in 1965 in an artistic
            family. Since he was very young, he benefited from the knowledge of
            many great masters which the same provided the grounds for him to
            create unique works in the arts and architecture. He graduated in
            April of 1992 from University of Science and Technology with a
            master in Architectural Engineering and Urban Designing. He began to
            demonstrate his manifested method in designing which has been based
            on meticulous creativity. Components such as beauty, deep human
            feelings and caring about nature, formed a part of his subjectivity.
            His viewpoint should be followed in the book of existence, creation
            and architecture which has placed the most complicated aspects of
            creativity in <i>architecture</i> and <i>arts</i>, like creation in
            nature, on display.

            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

            <p>
              Is it possible to consider a piece of rock to massive galaxies all
              without any intermediaries as the objectivity of art? Yes,
              provided that we are after discovering art and not inventing art.
            </p>
            <img src="/image/sketchspix02.jpg" alt="Kambiz Jalali" />
            <p>
              At the same time that we are deeply watching the magnificent views
              of nature , we are also under the interaction of our own
              subjective imagination and a corner of nature just like when are
              watching an artwork in a museum.
            </p>
            <img src="/image/sketchspix03.jpg" alt="Kambiz Jalali" />
            <p>
              Art is flowing freely in nature and passes us by without
              consideration of our logics, like a unique artist that we do not
              know and we pass by him carelessly.
            </p>
            <img src="/image/2.jpg" alt="Kambiz Jalali" />
            <p>
              However, it is exactly the art hidden in nature that have taught
              creativity to mankind throughout history.
            </p>
            <img src="/image/sketchspix06.jpg" alt="Kambiz Jalali" />
            <p>
              Whenever and wherever that the creative force of mankind could
              manifest itself, the effect of art has been a fundamental force
              then and there as well.
            </p>
            <img src="/image/sketchspix08.jpg" alt="Kambiz Jalali" />
            <p>
              It is of no difference which of the mankind achievements are we
              talking about, as anything that art touches, it will convert to a
              discovery, creativity or a skill. Thereby I have always considered
              the role of art beyond its decorative aspects for a certain people
              who were able to afford purchasing art.
            </p>
            <img src="/image/sketchspix11.jpg" alt="Kambiz Jalali" />
            <p>
              Art is life itself and it should be formed in us from childhood
              and to realize this idea we need to start from our homes. Each
              home is the most important place that can award the power of
              creativity to its residents. Homes give a sense that its effect
              will be eternal and if such a sense is art, then creative children
              would grow in that home. Those are the ones who someday reveal
              their inner miracle in one of the fields of art science. Decoding
              art for the general public based on a new definition is indeed the
              key to the future world.

            <p>
              If we assumed drawing a part of nature is sufficient to be as the
              truth of nature, today we need to follow human ideals in a
              comprehensive connection between art and knowledge. All of the
              pioneering achievements of mankind , whether traveling to far
              galaxies or searching for eternal life in genetic science, all
              require scientists and artists who go beyond the known borders of
              science and art and are able to make a two way communication
              between them. Architecture is not excluded from this rule. Since
              the old timers, architecture have formed the life of mankind and
              have given the sense of security to mankind. It can be therefore
              imagined that all of our feelings about architecture are even
              carved in our genes. That is why I have always trusted deep
              feelings of people in designing and have never doubted myself in
              recovering their lost but unique feelings. I wanted to recreate
              the past, the present and the future in the essence of building .
              For the purpose of realizing this idea, within a particular period
              of my work life, the path I chose was focusing on the most
              fundamental feelings of mankind and I have avoided utilization of
              any complicated form in design because I knew I could not achive
              my targets with visible aspects. I knew that I should put together
              a special structure in connection with senses , so primarily I
              have attempted to make the basis tangible and perceptible , like
              there is tendency to touch some parts of it and to recover the
              rough and some extent the harsh surface of the nature in it. I,
              therefore, taken into consideration a special focus on using
              plants. I desired the existing plants on the paths be of the kind
              that you can pick them and to taste their spiciness and
              provocativeness. Caressing of the sound of water with its sense of
              freshness and verdancy, mixed with the aroma of lemon blossoms ,
              were simple subjects which were impossible to forget , because
              they were all small parts of the everlasting and eternal forces in
              nature. So, these experiences taught me that architecture is not
              just a beautiful cover for space . In order to realize a good
              architecture, therefore, we need to touch the depth of human
              feelings.
